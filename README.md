## Testing URL Routes

This project includes three different tools for testing URL routes and finding broken links:

### 1. URL Checker (Basic)

Tests a predefined list of URLs expected to work on the site:

```bash
npm run test:urls
```

This tool:

- Starts a development server
- Tests a predefined list of important URLs for 200 status codes
- Provides a summary of successful and failed URLs
- Automatically stops the server after completion

### 2. Site Crawler (Complete)

Crawls the entire site starting from the homepage, finding all linked pages:

```bash
npm run test:crawl
```

This tool:

- Starts a development server
- Crawls every link it finds recursively
- Reports all broken internal links
- Provides a detailed report of issues found
- Automatically stops the server after completion

### 3. Link Checker (Comprehensive)

The recommended way to test the entire site:

```bash
# First start the server in another terminal
npm run dev

# Then run the link checker
npm test
```

This tool:

- Requires a running server on port 4333
- Crawls all internal links and reports their status
- Can check external links too (configurable)
- Shows a real-time progress indicator
- Provides a detailed report of broken links
